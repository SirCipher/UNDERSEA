Case study 1
----
Demonstrating automatic task decomposition, distribution and execution to local cluster clients. A leader is automatically elected and distributes the mission to the clients.

The video also demonstrates the leader being killed and a new one elected. The new mission is re-decomposed and distributed to the available clients. The same functionality is demonstrated by a follower failing.

Case study 2
----
Demonstrating automatic task decomposition, distribution and execution to local cluster clients. An agent is assigned a mission but then fails, notifies its leader and the leader assigns the remaining agents in the cluster to the mission.

The video also demonstrates the leader being killed and a new one elected. The new mission is re-decomposed and distributed to the available clients. The same functionality is demonstrated by a follower failing.
